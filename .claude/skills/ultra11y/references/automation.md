# Automate in the repo — `init` (hook / CI)

ultra11y can stay an **on-demand** skill, or become a **gate** that runs on its own.
`init` wires it (zero-dependency, no husky):

```
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs init --hook          # .git/hooks/pre-commit — strict STAGED gate (default)
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs init                 # same as --hook
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs init --ci            # .github/workflows/a11y.yml (PR diff vs base)
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs init --baseline …    # opt into the legacy regression gate (below)
```

## Default: strict staged snapshot + safe auto-fix

The default pre-commit hook operates on **exactly what is about to be committed** — the
**staged index blobs**, read with `git show :./<path>`, *not* the working-tree copy.
It runs (fix first, then gate — so safe fixes are always applied, and only the judgment
issues that remain can block):

```
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs fix   --staged --write --safe            # auto-apply SAFE fixes to the staged snapshot, re-stage
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs audit --staged --fail-on blocking        # gate: block only if issues remain (need judgment)
```

Why fix-first: every auto-fixable rule (positive `tabindex`, redundant `role`,
zoom-blocking viewport) is `major`/`minor`, while the `blocking` findings (missing `alt`,
missing label) are exactly the ones a codemod must **not** guess. So the safe pass cleans
up and re-stages what it can, and the gate blocks only on the judgment remainder for the AI
agent to adjudicate.

- **`--staged`** scopes to staged adds/mods only (not untracked, not unstaged-only edits)
  and audits the exact bytes a commit would record — including `.gitattributes` clean
  filters. `--staged` wins over `--changed`/`--since`.
- **`--safe`** applies only genuinely-**automatic** codemods. Placeholder inserts
  (`alt="TODO"`, `lang="und"`, `title="TODO"`) are **not** applied: a stub would clear the
  finding mechanically while still needing a real value, so those (and judgment proposals)
  are left in place and keep the gate blocking.
- **Auto-fix + re-stage** happens only for **fully-staged** files (working tree == index).
  A **partially-staged** file (unstaged edits present) is left untouched — writing
  index-derived output over it and `git add`-ing would silently stage those edits — so its
  findings keep the gate blocking with a message to stage/fix it manually.
- The commit proceeds only when no blocking issue remains after the safe pass. One-off
  bypass: `SKIP_A11Y=1 git commit …`. Engine path override: `ULTRA11Y=/path/to/ultra11y.mjs`.

**When the hook blocks on judgment issues** (alt relevance, link purpose, labels,
heading structure) the agent should: open the cited **staged** code, apply the *real*
fix (not a placeholder), `git add` the file, and re-commit — or run `fix --staged
--write` to lay down placeholders and then fill them in.

## MUST: the FINAL, rendered semantic HTML has to be correct

The static engine only sees **source**. When markup comes from a **component library**
(DSFR, MUI, Chakra…) or a `.vue`/`.svelte`/`.astro` SFC, the real **semantic HTML** only
exists **after rendering** — the source `<Button/>` tells you nothing about the `<button>`
(or `<div role>`) it emits. A green staged gate on opaque component source is **not**
proof of an accessible result.

**So make the produced semantic HTML the thing you gate — with rendered CAPTURES.** A
capture is the *rendered* DOM serialized to `.html` and committed, so the gate audits the
true markup, not the component call. Zero-touch setup (your tests do the rendering):

```
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs render --setup             # install the capture harvester into your test runner
npm test                                              # every rendered component → .ultra11y/captures/*.html (provenance-tagged)
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs audit --require-captures    # gate: every opaque/control component must have a capture
```

- **Attribution + coverage.** A finding on a capture is reported against the SOURCE
  component (via its `<!-- ultra11y:capture … -->` provenance), not the capture file.
  `render --coverage` shows covered vs blind-spot components; `--require-captures` turns any
  remaining blind spot into a failure. `.vue`/`.svelte`/`.astro` components now count in this
  coverage too, so a previously-green gate can newly report blind spots on an SFC-heavy repo —
  intended (a named blind spot beats invisibility); capture those components or scope the gate.
- **The gate sees the captures for the diffed components automatically.** In
  `--changed`/`--staged`/`--since` mode the audit pulls in the committed captures whose
  provenance points at a diffed source file (a capture is rarely itself part of the diff —
  the SOURCE changed, its capture usually didn't), so the pre-commit gate audits the real
  `<button>`/`<nav>`/heading structure/labels for every touched component, catching
  regressions the opaque source hides. After a component change, re-run your tests so its
  capture refreshes, and stage the refreshed capture with the source. `fix` never rewrites
  captures (generated output). Storybook/build HTML and manual Testing-Library dumps also
  work — anything under `.ultra11y/captures`, or point `--captures <dir>` (`--no-captures`
  opts out entirely).
- In CI, audit the **built** output (`audit "dist/**/*.html"`), and use `scan` for the
  computed rendering criteria (contrast, focus, zoom). See `references/rendered.md`.

Treat this as a hard rule: **do not sign off on a component/SFC change from the source
audit alone — verify the rendered semantic HTML, and prefer committed captures so the
gate keeps verifying it.**

## Opt-in: baseline regression gate (legacy)

For large existing backlogs, keep the original "only block NEW regressions" gate. It is
opt-in via `--baseline` (or an explicit `--fail-on`), and is what `--ci` uses:

```
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs init --baseline      # writes audits/baseline.json (commit it)
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs init --hook --baseline
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs init --ci            # audit --since <base> --baseline … in Actions
```

The hook/CI then run `audit --changed --baseline audits/baseline.json --fail-on blocking`:
the audit is restricted to the **diff**, and only **NEW** non-conformities at/above the
threshold fail — the existing backlog never blocks. Finding identity `(rule, criterion,
file, source range)` is robust to line drift. **Commit `audits/baseline.json`** (add a
`!audits/baseline.json` negation if `audits/` is git-ignored) and refresh it as you burn
down backlog. `--fail-on blocking|major|minor` sets the threshold (French aliases
`bloquant|majeur|mineur` accepted).

> Either gate relies on the **static** engine. The **rendering** (contrast, focus, zoom) criteria
> go to `scan` and the **judgment** criteria are adjudicated by the AI agent (`verify --manual`,
> gated) in the full audit — the gate stops mechanical regressions, it is not the full audit
> (a human is at most optional oversight).
